ABOUT
-----
Movies are awesome. They were, they are and they always will be. phpMyProfiler
is a great application to share information about your movie collection with
others. The Bstrap theme wants to bring phpMyProfiler theme-ing to another
level - besides of a modern HTML5 and CSS3 architecture it makes the web app
responsive most of all. 

Imagine hanging out at a bar with your friends around you, a beer in one hand
and your mobile device in the other, scrolling through your latest additions
to your collection with a web design that adjusts to your device. Isn't that
just cool?

"Bootstrap" has become a very popular framework for such responsive design.
The "Bstrap" theme bases on that framework. It was fun creating it, and here
it is for you. Enjoy!

REQUIREMENTS
------------
1. phpMyProfiler 1.1
2. HTML5/CSS3 compatible browser

INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. Download the bstrap theme archive
2. Unzip and copy bstrap folder into your phpMyprofiler themes folder

The folder structure should look like this afterwards:

- <your phpMyProfiler folder>
  |
  |...
  |- themes
  |  |
  |  |- bstrap
  |  |- default
  ...

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
The Bstrap theme comes with 13 skins. Besides the default Bootstrap skin you
can select from 12 more skins created by the great Bootswatch team. In order
to select a default skin you need to login to the admin backend of phpMyProfiler,
go to "Change Preferences", select the "Parser Settings" tab and select the
skin in the "Theme CSS" drop down. Save the config and refresh your front end.

In the frontend you can select an alternate skin from the phpMyProfiler menu
that will remain for the current session (well, mostly. At least enough to 
make a decision whether to set it as the default in the administration.). 
This is not possible in the admin backend.

In its current release, phpMyProfiler does not support to select a different
theme (and skin) for the admin interface. I decided to place a horizontal
orange line right underneath the menu bar at the top as an indicator that
you are in the admin backend. 
  
NOTE:
-----
The theme pack contains no changes to any functionalty of phpMyProfiler. It
just displays it differently. In order to use the theme pack to its full
functionality you need an HTML5 and CSS3 compatible browser.

SUPPORT:
--------
I will give support for this theme to my best availability in the phpMyProfiler
forum at: https://forum.phpmyprofiler.de


Best regards and enjoy
